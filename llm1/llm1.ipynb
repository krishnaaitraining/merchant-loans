      "ChatCompletionMessage(content='Well, sugar, JavaScript is a mighty flexible language, bless its heart. You see, semicolons are technically optional in JavaScript due to a feature called \"Automatic Semicolon Insertion\" (ASI). This means the language has an automatic way of popping those semicolons in places where it thinks they oughta be, even if you don’t put \\'em there yourself.\\n\\nBut, there\\'s a catch, darlin\\'. Just because it can doesn’t mean it always gets it right. Omitting semicolons can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially in certain tricky situations. For instance, if you start a new line with an array or function call without a semicolon ending the previous line, JavaScript might get all flustered and won\\'t understand your intent.\\n\\nSo, while you might get away without \\'em most of the time, the safe practice, if you wanna keep things tidy and avoid unexpected hiccups, is to use semicolons at the end of your statements.
